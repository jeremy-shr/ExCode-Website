# ExCode Website (2023-24 Version)

I took on this codebase from predecessors in my role as Head of Tech for Exeter Entrepreneurs. The website was outdated and lacked functionality that we (the society's commitee) needed as we wanted to use the website for marketing and registrations to the programme.  

My job involved redesigning certain aspects of the website for our purposes, upgrading functionality and supporting responsiveness as most traffic will be on mobile. During the development, I was in contact with the Head of Marketing to make sure I was designing a product that fitted the programme's marketing needs.

## About ExCode

ExCode is a programme hosted every year by Exeter Entrepreneurs Society that allows any student of Exeter University to learn code in an engaging and supportive environment. It consists of a half hour lecture by the Head of Tech and then an hour long workshop with smaller groups. 

Attendance is usually of 400 in-person (filling the University's largest auditorium). And around 100 more online from a seperate campus and if there wasn't enough room in person for everyone who registered. 

ExCode is open to all and is constantly evolving to respond to the feedback of students who have gone through the programme.  


## Challenges
A few of the technologies used in this project previously were new to me./ This meant I was in the dark regarding some aspects of it. However, this meant I could learn by trying and failing on a project with real application and importance. This is always an effective way to learn and I'm grateful that my first task as Head of Tech has taught me so much.  

There was also a lack of any responsiveness for mobile devices across the website's pages. As we would have people scanning a QR code to access the website on their phones, this was high priority. However, inconsistent methods of styling mean this was a challenge.  


## Suggestions for Future modification

Use a container manager such as Docker. This is to avoid dependency issues.  

Add functionality to register within the website? This could help with future admin tasks.
